Quantum Snakes & Ladders with AI Integration:
This project is a modern take on the classic Snakes and Ladders game, built in Python with an interactive Pygame interface and AI integration. It features a 10x10 board with snakes, ladders, and power-ups. Players can be either human or AI-controlled, with the AI making decisions using the Minimax algorithm enhanced with alpha-beta pruning.

A custom heuristic function guides the AI by evaluating positions based on:

Current tile position (progress toward tile 100),

Power-up possession (reroll bonus),

Snake and ladder proximity (penalties and bonuses).

The game includes real-time turn switching, reroll power-up mechanics, and a clean, visually intuitive GUI. Designed for both fun and strategy, this project blends traditional gameplay with smart decision-making and engaging visuals.
